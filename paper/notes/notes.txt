Interpretation and Story:
Title: Self-Reflecting DRL agents palying CPSU
agents learns to develop 3.4 Hz peak with increasing reward!
correction: learns to balance ratio between different peaks or more general, learns to find the right frequency components
retrain agent with new reward function not solely based on pendulum y pos but with dependence on frequency of the movement.
normal reward during episoed, after each episode shape cumulative episodic reward based on freq development!
check whether refined reward function accelerates learning
suggest that agent can learn to develop his own reward and/or extract important features from his experience
questionable is its ability to recognize the 3.4 Hz peak as a feature to be incorporated into his own reward+
